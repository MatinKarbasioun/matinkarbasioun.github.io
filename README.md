# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Matin Karbasioun!

I am a Software Developer and AI Enthusiast with over five years of experience in developing intelligent agents, real-time data processing systems, and designing algorithms. My background in Energy Systems Engineering, combined with a strong passion for artificial intelligence, has led me to explore the intersection of AI, machine learning, and decision-making.

I have pursued extensive self-study, earning certifications from institutions like Stanford University and Deeplearning.ai, and have applied this knowledge in real-world projects, particularly in financial markets. As the founder of **NeuroVortex**, I share my AI and reinforcement learning projects with the open-source community.

My goal is to contribute to innovative AI-driven solutions that make a real impact. Let's collaborate and build something amazing together!
